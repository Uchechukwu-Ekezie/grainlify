# Grainlify Documentation

Grainlify is **grant execution infrastructure for open-source ecosystems**. It converts ecosystem funding into **automated, verifiable, non‑custodial payouts** for open‑source contributions, using on‑chain escrow and off‑chain intelligence tied to real GitHub work.

This documentation is written for a **production deployment** of Grainlify and is intended for:

- **Ecosystem teams** (foundations, DAOs, L1/L2 orgs) running grant programs and hackathons.
- **Project maintainers** registering repositories and managing bounties.
- **Contributors** earning rewards for GitHub issues and pull requests.
- **Operators / developers** deploying, operating, and integrating Grainlify.
